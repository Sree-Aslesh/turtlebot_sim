# turtlebot_sim
 
 The main aim of this repository is to help robotics enthusiasts new to concepts like ROS understand what is actually happening behind the scenes of the navigation stack. Yeah, at first I thought what you might be thinking now, navigation stack is pretty well documented and so are various SLAM methods. Honestly, although that is very true , I never understood all that went into implementing the SLAM algorithm on a robot until I built most of the pieces up from scratch. So, if you're in the same situation I was then clone the repo and try coding it up yourself.
